# Exploratory Data Analysis on Loan Prediction Dataset
EDA is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

Here, I did EDA on Loan Prediction Dataset which means,
- Analyzing relationships among the features
- Distribution of the features
- Correlation among the features and so on.
