# Loan Prediction
The objective is to predict whether a loan application will be accepted in order to automate the loan eligibility process for the banks considering lots of features like Gender,Education,Applicant Income,Loan Amount,Property area, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis on Loan Prediction Dataset
EDA is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

Here, I did EDA on Loan Prediction Dataset which means,
- Analyzing relationships among the features
- Distribution of the features
- Correlation among the features and so on.

## Model Building
After the EDA process, I did some Feature Engineering works to make our data for model building.
Then I build some of the classification models to find which model will perform in a better manner and finally got some good accuracy from our model!
